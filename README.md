first_config: basic setup modified from Primeagen tutorial
    TODO: 
        1) need a better git tool, especially for merges - be able to work with the code with the edits shown during merges
        2) could do with a nicer tmux interface
        3) also with better tmux integration, apparently there are some tools to make it seamless
        4) make sure linting / lsp stuff is completely uniform: works on desktop but missing fonts elsewhere
        5) linter messages are pretty unhelpful sometimes
        6) customized formatting for python files based on my own style
        7) write function to comment out blocks which detects the file type and act accordingly
        8) python print lines annotation (turning "print(len(something))" into "print('len(something)', len(something)" via keymap
