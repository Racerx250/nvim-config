first_config: basic setup modified from Primeagen tutorial
    TODO: 
        1) need a better git tool, especially for merges - like to be able to work with the code with the edits shown during merges
        2) could do with a nicer tmux interface
        3) also with better tmux integration, apparently there are some tools to make it seamless
        4) make sure linting / lsp stuff is completely uniform: works on desktop but missing fonts elsewhere
        5) linter messages are pretty unhelpful sometimes
        6) customized formatting for python files based on my own style
